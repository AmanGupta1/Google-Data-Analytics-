First file to start with is Task_Events where we have plotted the graph between 'CPU Requested' and 'Memory Requested'.

After that, File named 'Machine_Events' is analyzed and plotted the graph between 'CPU Requested', 'Memory Requested',
'CPU Available' and 'Memory Available'. 

We found out that "So, while demand varies up and down among tasks that 
have been submitted to the system whereas availablity remains fairly constant".

The "Demand" for memory and cpu stay above availability, with some notable dips for memory.

Some statistics have been recorded from 'Machine_Events' file which provides the information about Percentage of Machines
used or available for different attributes in 'Machine_Events' file.
